Saskia Freeke is an artist, creative coder, interaction and visual designer. Saskia’s art practise explores visual design that is generated with code. She has been making daily artworks since January 2015, exploring the aesthetics in geometric patterns and animations.
 
Saskia is interested in making playful interactive artworks that have novel tangible interfaces. Her research focuses on the cultural aspect of the interface, on the space between the human and the machine and what kind of effect certain interactions and interfaces have. Her interactive artworks are focused on creating a playful experience, allowing the user freedom to explore. 
 
Besides Saskia’s artistic practise, she works as a freelance interaction and visual designer. She was selected to be a Processing Foundation Fellow of 2017, and is the director of education for Code Liberation Foundation. Saskia has also previously been teaching in games and interaction design at the University of the Arts Utrecht School for Games and Interaction.
